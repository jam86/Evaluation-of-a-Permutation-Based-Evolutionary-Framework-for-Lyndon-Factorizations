We want to compare the average max, min and stdev factor length for each
protein factoring for every genome for the two fitness functions with
the original Duval's algorithm factors

Data is from "duvals factoring".

Run:
python3 duvalsMaxMinStdevAverageFactors.py testingFirst30OriginalDuvalsFactors.csv

Output is a table line for latex

Data:
testingDuvalsAminoAcidFactors.csv from "data.tar.xz/DA for table 6"
